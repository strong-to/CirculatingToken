Anyone holding those tokens becomes a co-owner of that project's future cash flow and governance. At the community layer, THE4 is organized as a Covenant: its community token represents the collective rights and responsibilities of all participants. Holders of the Covenant token can propose and vote on governance matters that shape the direction of THE4."
